  "Summary": "Goblin initiates by reading conjuration and ritual logs, Wizard executes assigned tasks, then Goblin reviews git diffs and updates ritual and conjuration logs. ritualc.sh automates whispers summarization and orchestrates goblin_ritual_A.sh, wizard_ritual.sh, and goblin_ritual_B.sh.",
  "Success Definition": "ritualc.sh correctly summarizes previous whispers using Mistral, maintains .whispers.txt, and executes goblin and wizard rituals in order with accurate log updates. Conjuration and ritual logs should reflect completed tasks with timestamps.",
